# Very Deep Learning Project

## Get the dataset

Run `bin/get-data` to download the [dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
There's 5.5 Gb worth of data, so this will take a while.
You will need [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install).

Then, build the index file with `bin/build-index`. This takes around 15 minutes.
